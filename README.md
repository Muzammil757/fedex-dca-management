#Digital and AI powered solutions for  DCA Management Platform – FedEx Hackathon

## Problem Statement
Managing overdue customer accounts through external Debt Collection Agencies (DCAs) is currently manual,Time taking, fragmented, and opaque. The existing process relies on spreadsheets, emails, and manual follow-ups, leading to delayed recoveries, weak governance, and limited visibility.The process is not trustworthy too.

## Proposed Solution

A centralized, AI-enabled DCA Management Platform that replaces manual, spreadsheet-driven debt recovery with a structured, transparent, and scalable digital workflow.

The solution demonstrated through the live website provides:
 1.Centralized case lifecycle management from allocation to closure
 2. AI-driven case prioritization and recovery risk indicators
 3. SLA-based workflow tracking with escalation visibility
 4.Real-time dashboards for recovery, risk, and performance
 5.Structured collaboration and accountability for DCAs
 6.Comparative DCA performance and SLA adherence insights
 7. Audit-ready tracking for governance and compliance
 8.Modular, future-ready design for AI, automation, and RPA integration

This approach improves recovery efficiency, predictability, and operational control at enterprise scale.


## Key Features
- Centralized case management dashboard
- AI-based recovery probability & prioritization
- SLA-driven workflows and escalation tracking
- DCA performance analytics
- Role-based enterprise & DCA views
- Audit-ready tracking and governance

## UI Demonstrated Features (Live Website)

The live UI prototype demonstrates several advanced and value-added features that go beyond basic case listing, showcasing how the platform improves usability, intelligence, and governance:

- **Interactive Case Selection**: Selecting a case dynamically updates the case details panel with customer, aging, amount, and status information.
- **AI-Driven Indicators (Visual)**:
  - Recovery probability scores
  - Risk-based priority levels
  - High-risk case highlighting
- **SLA Tracking Visualization**:
  - SLA status badges
  - Progress indicators for escalation timelines
- **Aging Bucket Insights**:
  - Categorization of cases (0–30, 31–60, 60+ days)
  - Visual risk cues for overdue severity
- **DCA Performance View**:
  - Comparative recovery rates
  - SLA adherence indicators
- **Role-Based View Toggle (Conceptual)**:
  - Enterprise vs DCA perspective (visual representation)
- **Audit & Governance Readiness**:
  - Notes and status update tracking
  - Clear ownership and accountability indicators

These features collectively demonstrate how the proposed solution replaces manual spreadsheet-driven workflows with a centralized, intelligent, and transparent digital platform.


## Platform Architecture
