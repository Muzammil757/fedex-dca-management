## AI Model Overview

This module is designed to support AI/ML models for:
- Recovery probability prediction
- Risk scoring and case prioritization
- Expected recovery timeline estimation

In the current prototype, model outputs are simulated to demonstrate intelligent decision support. 
This structure allows seamless integration of real trained models in future phases.
